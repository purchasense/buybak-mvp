Located 90\u00a0km west of Italy, 170\u00a0km southeast of\nFrance and 11\u00a0km north of the island of Sardinia, the island is\na territorial collectivity of France, but many of the region's\nwinemaking traditions and its grape varieties are Italian in\norigin. The region's viticultural history can be traced to the\nisland's settlement by Phoceans traders in 570 BC in what is\nnow the commune of Al\u00e9ria. In the 18th century, the island\ncame under the control of France. Following the independence\nof Algeria from French rule, many Algerian Pieds-Noirs\nimmigrated to Corsica and began planting vineyards. Between\n1960 and 1976 the vineyard area in Corsica increased fourfold.\nIn 1968, Patrimonio was established as Corsica's first\nAppellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC). Today, Corsica has\nnine AOC regions including the island-wide designation Vin\nde Corse AOC. The majority of the wine exported from Corsica\nfalls under the Vin de pays designation Vin de Pays de l'\u00cele de\nBeaut\u00e9 (Country wine from the Island of Beauty). The three\nleading grape varieties of the region are Nielluccio\n(Sangiovese), known as the spice wine of France, Sciacarello\nand Vermentino.[1]\nThe island of Corsica was settled by Phoceans traders shortly after their founding of Massalia on the\nsoutheastern coast of France.[2] The Phoceans were active wine growers, cultivating indigenous vines\nand cuttings brought from abroad.[1] During the late 7th and early 8th century AD, the island came\nunder Islamic rule. Wine production was severely limited due to the Islamic prohibition of alcohol.[3]\nIn the early Middle Ages, Corsica first came under the rule of the city of Pisa in the Tuscany region,\nthen in the 13th century under that of the Republic of Genoa.[4] During this time some\nampelographers believe that a clone of the Sangiovese grape was introduced to the island which\nbecame Nielluccio.[5]\nOver the next 500 years, the Genoese established strict laws governing the harvest and winemaking\npractices of the island. They also banned all exports of Corsican wines to any port outside of Genoa.[1]\nThe most sought-after wines from Corsica were described as being made in the \"Greek style\" from the\nCap Corse region. In 1769, a year after the Genoese ceded control of the island to the French, the\nScottish writer James Boswell praised the diversity and quality of Corsican wines, comparing them\nfavorably to the wines of Malaga and Frontignan.[4] That same year, the future French emperor\nHistory\n5/22/25, 3:45 AM Corsican wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_wine 1/6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2739, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de18ca11-737b-4d51-b684-5f0247cec7a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "de18ca11-737b-4d51-b684-5f0247cec7a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 699863, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8dcea0c3-2ceb-4f0c-9c64-669526f972ad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 699863, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "46e5e942fe05944a6f4606ee869c493d98fc536dac51c7fd224e056f1d69c5d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The future French emperor Napoleon\nBonaparte was born to a Corsican\nwinemaking family in Ajaccio.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was born in the Corsican city of Ajaccio\nto a wine-producing family. Under Napoleon's rule, Corsica\nwas allowed to export wine and tobacco duty-free across the\nFrench Empire.[1]\nIn the 19th century, the Corsican government launched\nseveral efforts to improve the nation's economy by promoting\nCorsica's wine industry. These efforts included the widespread\nplanting of the indigenous Sciacarello grape and the\nconstruction of a large cellar near the city of Vizzavona, which\nwas located on the highest point on the railroad line that\nlinked the east coast city of Bastia with the capital city of\nAjaccio. The phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century dealt\na crippling blow to the Corsican wine industry, and was\nfollowed by a period of mass depopulation as Corsicans\nemigrated to other countries. The Algerian war of\nIndependence ushered in a new period of growth as French\npieds-noirs immigrated to Corsica and began new plantings.[4] During this time, the number of\nvineyards increased fourfold. The overall quality of Corsican wine was poor due to the emphasis on\nquantity over quality, with Corsica becoming a prominent contributor to Europe's wine lake problem.\nIn the 1980s, the European Union began issuing subsidies to encourage the uprooting of vines and to\nrenew focus on limited yields and quality wine production. By 2003, these programs had contributed\nto a reduction of over 17,300 acres (7,000\u00a0ha) in the number of vineyard plantings in Corsica, as well\nas the introduction of modern winemaking techniques and equipment such as temperature-controlled\nfermentation tanks.[1]\nThe island of Corsica is the most mountainous island in the Mediterranean. The climate is warmer\nand drier than in mainland France. During the peak growing month of July, the mean average\ntemperature is 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C). The average annual rainfall for most Corsica's wine growing regions is 29\ninches (740\u00a0mm) and 2.6 inches (66\u00a0mm) during the harvest month of September.[6] Very little rain\nfalls during months of August and September allowing for a dry, rot-free harvest for most vintages.\nCorsica averages around 2,750 hours of sunshine a year, with the nearby sea absorbing most of the\nheat during the day and radiating it back to the island at night. This creates a more consistent\ntemperature and sharply reduces the diurnal temperature variation. Throughout the mountainous\nterrain there are several mesoclimates created by the differing degrees of altitude, latitude and\nmaritime influences.[1]\nThere are several different soil types found in the wine growing regions of Corsica. In the northern\nregion consisting of the Cap Corse peninsula the soil is mainly schist. Just south of the Cap Corse is\nthe limestone-rich chalk and clay soil of the Patrimonio region. Along the west coast, the soil contains\na high concentration of granite. The vineyards planted on the east coast of the island between the\ncities of Solenzara and Bastia are planted mostly on marly sand.[1]\nClimate and geography\n5/22/25, 3:45 AM Corsican wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_wine 2/6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3198, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "868e5e27-5b62-478e-8691-8262fae32ea3": {"__data__": {"id_": "868e5e27-5b62-478e-8691-8262fae32ea3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 699863, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d9053b4-a715-4853-b5ee-cdd9a206bed6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Corsican wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 699863, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "f4ba068061443ea78645d985a0191ff95a05b46f4a8ccc3e5a8957a879b5853f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Most of Corsica's vineyards are located\naround the coast.\nCorsica's wine regions: (1) Cap Corse,\n(2) Patrimonio, (3) Calvi, (4) Ajaccio, (5)\nSart\u00e8ne, (6) Figari, (7) Porto-Vecchio, (8)\nGreater Vin de Corse region.

Additional viticultural hazards include downy mildew and powdery mildew.[1]\nThe European Union grant programs have encouraged many Corsican wineries to upgrade their\nfacilities with temperature controlled stainless steel fermentation tanks.
