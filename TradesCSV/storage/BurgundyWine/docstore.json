The most famous wines\nproduced here, and those commonly referred to as\n\"Burgundies\", are dry red wines made from pinot noir\ngrapes and white wines made from chardonnay grapes.\nRed and white wines are also made from other grape\nvarieties, such as gamay and aligot\u00e9, respectively.

Chardonnay-dominated Chablis and\ngamay-dominated Beaujolais are recognised as part of\nthe Burgundy wine region, but wines from those\nsubregions are usually referred to by their own names\nrather than as \"Burgundy wines\".\nBurgundy has a higher number of appellations d'origine\ncontr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOCs) than any other French region, and is\noften seen as the most terroir-conscious of the French\nwine regions. The various Burgundy AOCs are classified\nfrom carefully delineated grand cru vineyards down to\nmore non-specific regional appellations. The practice of\ndelineating vineyards by their terroir in Burgundy goes\nback to medieval times, when various monasteries\nplayed a key role in developing the Burgundy wine\nindustry. The historical importance of the Burgundy\nwine region and its unique climats system led to sites in\nthe region being inscribed on the UNESCO World\nHeritage List as part of the Climats, terroirs of\nBurgundy site.[2]\nThe Burgundy region runs from Auxerre in the north to\nM\u00e2con in the south, or to Lyon if the Beaujolais area is\nincluded as part of Burgundy.

These are\nBourgogne, village, premier cru and grand cru.[3]\nEighty-five miles southeast of Chablis is the C\u00f4te d'Or,\nwhere Burgundy's most famous and most expensive\nwines originate, and where all Grand Cru vineyards of\nBurgundy (except for chablis grand cru) are situated.\nThe C\u00f4te d'Or itself is split into two parts: the C\u00f4te de\nNuits which starts just south of Dijon and runs till\nCorgoloin, a few kilometers south of the town of Nuits-\nSaint-Georges, and the C\u00f4te de Beaune which starts at\nLadoix and ends at Dezize-les-Maranges. The wine-\ngrowing part of this area in the heart of Burgundy is just\n40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) long, and in most places less than\n2 kilometres (1.2\u00a0mi) wide. The area is made up of tiny\nvillages surrounded by a combination of flat and sloped\nvineyards on the eastern side of a hilly region, providing\nsome rain and weather shelter from the prevailing\nwesterly winds. The best wines - from grand cru\nvineyards - of this region are usually grown from the\nmiddle and higher part of the slopes, where the\nvineyards have the most exposure to sunshine and the\nbest drainage, while the premier cru come from a little\nless favourably exposed slopes. The relatively ordinary\n\"village\" wines are produced from the flat territory\nnearer the villages. The C\u00f4te de Nuits contains 24 out of\nthe 25 red grand cru appellations in Burgundy, while all\nbut one of the region's white Grand Cru wines are in the\nC\u00f4te de Beaune (the exception being Musigny blanc).\nThis is explained by the presence of different soils,\nwhich favour pinot noir and chardonnay, respectively.\nFurther south is the C\u00f4te Chalonnaise, where again a mix of mostly red and white wines are produced,\nalthough the appellations found here such as Mercurey, Rully and Givry are less well-known than\ntheir counterparts in the C\u00f4te d'Or.\nBelow the C\u00f4te Chalonnaise is the M\u00e2connais region, known for producing large quantities of easy-\ndrinking and more affordable white wine. Further south again is the Beaujolais region, famous for\nfruity red wines made from Gamay grapes.\n5/22/25, 3:44 AM Burgundy wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_wine 2/12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2968, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88629c91-e415-4ad3-8f51-5de00d583b31": {"__data__": {"id_": "88629c91-e415-4ad3-8f51-5de00d583b31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2af462e-2065-4a9d-902c-64de9c66773d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "32e91d2eb7a9b346b891aedc9cf4dd8c25e4e0ef95e79712fbe487452d35a7d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Harvest time in the Chablis Premier Cru\nof Fourchaume\nBurgundy's terrain is continental climate characterized by cold winters and hot summers.

Such a climate results in\nvintages from Burgundy varying considerably.\nArchaeological evidence establishes viticulture in Burgundy as\nearly as the second century AD, although the Celts may have\nbeen growing vines in the region previous to the Roman\nconquest of Gaul in 51 BC. Greek traders, for whom viticulture\nhad been practiced since the late Neolithic period, had\nfounded Massal\u00eda in about 600 BC, and traded extensively up\nthe Rh\u00f4ne valley, where the Romans first arrived in the\nsecond century BC. The earliest recorded praise of the wines\nof Burgundy was written in 591 by Gregory of Tours, who\ncompared it to the Roman wine Falernian.[1]\nMonks and monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church have\nhad an important influence on the history of Burgundy wine.\nThe first known donation of a vineyard to the Church was by King Guntram in 587, but the influence\nof the Church became important in Charlemagne's era. The Benedictines, through their Abbey of\nCluny founded in 910, became the first truly big Burgundy vineyard owner over the following\ncenturies. Another order which exerted influence was the Cistercians, founded in 1098 and named\nafter C\u00eeteaux, their first monastery, situated in Burgundy. The Cistercians created Burgundy's largest\nwall-surrounded vineyard, the Clos de Vougeot, in 1336. More importantly, the Cistercians, extensive\nvineyard owners as they were, were the first to notice that different vineyard plots gave consistently\ndifferent wines. They therefore laid the earliest foundation for the naming of Burgundy crus and the\nregion's terroir thinking.[1]\nSince Burgundy is land-locked, very little of its wine left the region in medieval times, when wine was\ntransported in barrels, meaning that waterways provided the only practical means of long-range\ntransportation. The only part of Burgundy which could reach Paris in a practical way was the area\naround Auxerre by means of the Yonne. This area includes Chablis, but had much more extensive\nvineyards until the 19th century. These were the wines referred to as vin de Bourgogne in early texts.\nThe wines from C\u00f4te d'Or would then be called (vin de) Beaune. These wines first became famous in\nthe 14th century, during the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy in Avignon, which was reachable by\nSa\u00f4ne and Rh\u00f4ne after some overland transport. In the extravagance of the papal court, Beaune was\ngenerally seen as the finest wine, and better than anything available in Rome at that time.[1]\nThe status of Burgundy wines continued in the court of the House of Valois, which ruled as Dukes of\nBurgundy for much of the 14th and 15th centuries. Their ban on the import and export of non-\nBurgundian wines, effectively shutting out the then popular wines of the Rhone Valley from Northern\nEuropean markets, gave a considerable boost to the Burgundy wine industry.[4] It was during this era\nthat the first reliable references to grape varieties in Burgundy were made.

On 6 August 1395,[5] Duke Philip the\nBold issued a decree concerned with safeguarding the quality of Burgundy wines. The duke declared\nthe \"vile and disloyal Gamay\"[6]\u2014which was a higher-yielding grape than Pinot noir in the 14th\ncentury, as it is today\u2014unfit for human consumption and banned the use of organic fertilizer\n(manure), which probably increased yields even further to the detriment of quality. High-quality white\nBurgundy wines of this era were probably made from Fromenteau, which is known as a quality grape\nin northeastern France in this time. Fromenteau is probably the same variety as today's Pinot gris.\nChardonnay is a much later addition to Burgundy's vineyards.[1]\nIn the 18th century, the quality of roads in France became progressively better, which facilitated\ncommerce in Burgundy wines. The first n\u00e9gociant houses of the region were established in the 1720s\nand 1730s. In the 18th century, Burgundy and Champagne were rivals for the lucrative Paris market,\nto which Champagne had earlier access. The two regions overlapped much in wine styles in this era,\nsince Champagne was then primarily a producer of pale red still wines rather than of sparkling wines.\nA major work on Burgundy wines written by Claude Arnoux in 1728 deals with the famous red wines\nof C\u00f4te de Nuits and the \u0152il-de-Perdrix pink wines of Volnay, but only briefly mentions white\nwines.[1]\nAfter Burgundy became incorporated in the Kingdom of France, and the power of the Church\ndecreased, many vineyards which had been in the Church's hands were sold to the bourgeoisie from\nthe 17th century. After the French Revolution of 1789, the Church's remaining vineyards were broken\nup and from 1791 sold off.[1] The Napoleonic inheritance laws then resulted in the continued\nsubdivision of the most precious vineyard holdings, so some growers hold only a row or two of vines.\nThis led to the emergence of n\u00e9gociants who aggregate the produce of many growers to produce a\nsingle wine. It has also led to a profusion of increasingly smaller, family-owned wineries, exemplified\nby the dozen-plus Gros family domaines.\nThe awareness of the difference of quality and style of\nBurgundy wines produced from different vineyards\ngoes back to medieval times, with certain climats being\nmore highly rated than others. An early author on this\naspect of Burgundy wines was Denis Morelot with his\nLa Vigne et le Vin en C\u00f4te d'Or from 1831. In 1855, the\nsame year as the famous Bordeaux Wine Official\nClassification was launched, Dr. Jules Lavalle\npublished an influential book, Histoire et Statistique\nde la Vigne de Grands Vins de la C\u00f4te-d'Or, which\nincluded an unofficial classification of the Burgundy\nvineyards in five classes and which built on Morelot's\nbook. In decreasing order, Lavalle's five classes were hors ligne, t\u00eate de cuv\u00e9e, 1\u00e8re cuv\u00e9e, 2me cuv\u00e9e\nand 3me cuv\u00e9e.[7] Lavalle's classification was formalized in modified form by the Beaune Committee of\nAgriculture in 1861, and then consisted of three classes. Most of the \"first class\" vineyards of the 1861\nclassification were made into Grand Cru appellations d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9es when the national AOC\nlegislation was implemented in 1936.[1]\n5/22/25, 3:44 AM Burgundy wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_wine 4/12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3468, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c18353b9-4105-480b-a6da-b909098e73fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "c18353b9-4105-480b-a6da-b909098e73fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3375def-7713-4627-8dc1-6ac34819ae87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "d84566a29f928062af21462e5998b03834b47dacc3532f7b7ba5ff279d9aa7a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A label used on a 1984 bottle's neck,\nshowing the Burgundy coat of arms\nBurgundy wine has experienced much change over the past 75 years. Economic depression during the\n1930s was followed by the devastation caused by World War II. After the War, the vignerons returned\nhome to their unkempt vineyards. The soils and vines had suffered and were sorely in need of\nnurturing. The growers began to fertilize, bringing their vineyards back to health. Those who could\nafford it added potassium, a mineral fertilizer that contributes to vigorous growth. By the mid-1950s,\nthe soils were balanced, yields were reasonably low and the vineyards produced some of the most\nstunning wines in the 20th century.\nFor the next 30 years, they followed the advice of renowned viticultural experts, who advised them to\nkeep spraying their vineyards with chemical fertilizers, including potassium. While a certain amount\nof potassium is natural in the soil and beneficial for healthy growth, too much is harmful because it\nleads to low acidity levels, which adversely affect the quality of the wine.\nAs the concentration of chemicals in the soil increased, so did the yields. In the past 30 years, yields\nhave risen by two-thirds in the appellations contr\u00f4l\u00e9es vineyards of the C\u00f4te d'Or, from 29 hectoliters\nper hectare (hl/ha) (yearly average from 1951 to 1960) to almost 48 hl/ha (1982\u201391), according to a\nstudy by the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine. With higher yields came wines of less flavor\nand concentration. Within 30 years, the soils had been significantly depleted of their natural\nnutrients.\nThe period between 1985 and 1995 was a turning point in Burgundy. During this time, many\nBurgundian domaines renewed efforts in the vineyards and gradually set a new course in winemaking,\nproducing deeper, more complex wines. Today, the Burgundy wine industry is reaping the rewards of\nthose efforts.\nBurgundy is in some ways the most terroir-oriented region in\nFrance; immense attention is paid to the area of origin, and in\nwhich of the region's 400 types of soil a wine's grapes are\ngrown. As opposed to Bordeaux, where classifications are\nproducer-driven and awarded to individual chateaux,\nBurgundy classifications are geographically focused. A specific\nvineyard or region will bear a given classification, regardless\nof the wine's producer. This focus is reflected on the wine's\nlabels, where appellations are most prominent and producers'\nnames often appear at the bottom in much smaller text.\nThe main levels in the Burgundy classifications, in descending order of quality, are: Grand crus,\nPremier crus, village appellations, and finally regional appellations:[8][9][10]\nGrand Cru wines are produced by a small number of the best vineyard sites in the C\u00f4te d'Or\nregion, as strictly de\ufb01ned by the AOC laws. These Cru wines make up 2% of the production at 35\nhl/ha, and are generally produced in a style meant for cellaring, and typically need to be aged a\nminimum of \ufb01ve to seven years. The best examples can be kept for more than 15 years. Grand\nCru wines will only list the name of the vineyard as the appellation - such as Corton or Montrachet\n- on the wine label, plus the Grand Cru term, but not the village name.[ 1 1 ]  Several Grand Cru\nWine characteristics and classification\n5/22/25, 3:44 AM Burgundy wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_wine 5/12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3382, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18ed11f8-00af-4335-ba4f-a5af322aa1c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "18ed11f8-00af-4335-ba4f-a5af322aa1c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c5db9ef-a00c-4edb-8cbb-38aea7548a52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "c440344d4326c86e0fd66e4e78969cbf2a41080ed349280808043093986e721e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Premier Cru from Puligny-Montrachet\nvineyards have compound names (double-barrelled names),\nmostly due to adding a more famous vineyard which they\nneighbor, as in Charmes-Chambertin (adding Chambertin to\n\"Charmes\") or Roman\u00e9e-Saint-Vivant (adding La Roman\u00e9e to\n\"Saint-Vivant\"; these no longer quite neighbor), though other\ncompound names such as Corton-Charlemagne have\nidiosyncratic histories.

Compound names using a more\nfamous vineyard are sometimes referred to as \"satellites\" of\nthe more famous one.[ 1 2 ] [ 1 3 ] \nPremier Cru wines are produced from speci\ufb01c vineyard sites\nthat are still considered to be of high quality, but not as well\nregarded as the Grand Cru sites. Premier Cru wines make up\n12% of production at 45 hl/ha. These wines often should be\naged three to \ufb01ve years, and again the best wines can keep\nfor much longer. Premier Cru wines are labelled with the\nname of the village of origin, the Premier Cru status, and\nusually the vineyard name, for example, \"Volnay 1er Cru Les\nCaillerets\". Some Premier Cru wines are produced from\nseveral Premier Cru vineyards in the same village, and do not\ncarry the name of an individual vineyard.[ 1 4 ]  Blending premier\ncrus is more common in Morey-Saint-Denis than other\nvillages.[ 1 5 ] \nVillage appellation wines are produced from a blend of wines\nfrom supposedly lesser vineyard sites within the boundaries of\none of 42 villages, or from one individual but unclassi\ufb01ed\nvineyard. Wines from each different village are considered to\nhave their own speci\ufb01c qualities and characteristics,[ 9 ] [ 1 0 ]  and\nnot all Burgundy communes have a village appellation. Village\nwines make up 36% of production at 50 hl/ha. These wines\ncan be consumed two to four years after the release date, although again some examples will\nkeep for longer. Village wines will show the village name on the wine label, such as \"Pommard\",\nand sometimes - if applicable - the name of the single vineyard or climat where it was sourced.[ 1 6 ] \nSeveral villages in Burgundy have appended the names of their most famous Grand Cru\nvineyards to the original village name, for marketing reasons, resulting in double-barrelled names,\nstarting with \"Gevrey-Chambertin\" in 1847 and ending with \"Morey-Saint-Denis\" in 1927.[ 1 7 ] \nRegional appellation wines are wines which are allowed to be produced over the entire region, or\nover an area signi\ufb01cantly larger than that of an individual village.[ 1 8 ]  At the village, Premier Cru\nand Grand Cru levels, only red and white wines are found, but some of the regional appellations\nalso allow the production of ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines, as well as wines dominated by grape\nvarieties other than Pinot noir or Chardonnay.[ 8 ]  These appellations can be divided into three\ngroups:\nAOC Bourgogne, the standard or \"generic\" appellation for red or white wines made\nanywhere throughout the region, and represent simpler wines which are still similar to the\nvillage. These wines may be produced at 55 hl/ha. These wines are typically intended for\nimmediate consumption, within three years after the vintage date.\nSubregional (sous-r\u00e9gional) appellations cover a part of Burgundy larger than a village.\nExamples are Bourgogne Hautes-C\u00f4tes de Beaune, Bourgogne Hautes-C\u00f4tes de Nuits and\nM\u00e2con-Villages.[ 1 8 ]  Typically, those communes which do not have a village appellation will\n5/22/25, 3:44 AM Burgundy wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_wine 6/12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3626, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bad57f53-d62e-40e2-8b29-a67fe884cca6": {"__data__": {"id_": "bad57f53-d62e-40e2-8b29-a67fe884cca6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7f36b9e-9980-4fe6-82ad-348e2b49eb98", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "16e1c8fc7474b55a9a695c98f01715de38a2af11aed7983cf1e9fe3ef1587472", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A white wine made from declassi\ufb01ed\nAOC Meursault wine that is sold as a\ngeneral AOC Bourgogne\nAn AOC Bourgogne Pinot noir\nhave access to at\nleast one subregional\nappellation.

In the C\u00f4te de Nuits\nregion, 90% of the production is red grapes.\nRules for the red Burgundy appellations, from regional to Grand Cru level, generally allow up to 15%\nof the white grape varieties Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris to be blended in,[23] but this is not\nwidely practised today.\nBurgundy is home to some of the most expensive wines in the world, including those of Domaine de la\nRoman\u00e9e-Conti, Domaine Leroy, Henri Jayer, Domaine Leflaive and Domaine Armand Rousseau.\nGrape varieties\nReputation and appreciation\n5/22/25, 3:44 AM Burgundy wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_wine 8/12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2407, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aed59425-e2eb-4ffb-b74e-4a7739e41f95": {"__data__": {"id_": "aed59425-e2eb-4ffb-b74e-4a7739e41f95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e51e16c6-7a68-4750-a8db-6ed86b320b25", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Burgundy wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 917891, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "35cc83efe31bbe3d70f0a8a082008aaa7092d8387f7f3d5c9b8a15cca4228d67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Roman\u00e9e-Conti, a Burgundy wine, is\namong the world's most expensive wines.\nIts renown goes back many centuries; in 1522 Erasmus wrote:\n\"O happy Burgundy which merits being called the mother of\nmen since she furnishes from her mammaries such a good\nmilk\"[24] This was echoed by Shakespeare, who refers in King\nLear to \"the vines of France and milk of Burgundy\".\nBritish wine critic Jancis Robinson has stated that \"price is an\nextremely unreliable guide\" and \"what a wine sells for often\nhas more to do with advertising hype and marketing decisions\nthan the quality contained in the bottle\".
