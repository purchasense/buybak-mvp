EU law and the laws of most countries\nreserve the term \"champagne\" exclusively for\nwines that come from this region located about\n160 kilometres (100\u00a0miles) east of Paris. The\nviticultural boundaries of Champagne are\nlegally defined and split into five wine-\nproducing districts within the historical\nprovince: Aube, C\u00f4te des Blancs, C\u00f4te de\nS\u00e9zanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vall\u00e9e de la\nMarne. The city of Reims and the town of\n\u00c9pernay are the commercial centers of the area.\nReims is famous for its cathedral, the venue of\nthe coronation of the French kings and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[1]\nLocated at the northern edges of France, the history of the Champagne wine region has had a\nsignificant role in the development of this unique terroir. The area's proximity to Paris promoted the\nregion's economic success in its wine trade but also put the villages and vineyards in the path of\nmarching armies on their way to the French capital. Despite the frequency of these military conflicts,\nthe region developed a reputation for quality wine production in the early Middle Ages and was able to\ncontinue that reputation as the region's producers began making sparkling wine with the advent of the\ngreat champagne houses in the 17th and 18th centuries. The principal grapes grown in the region\ninclude Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier. Pinot noir is the most widely planted grape in the\nAube region and grows very well in Montagne de Reims. Pinot Meunier is the dominant grape in the\nVall\u00e9e de la Marne region. The C\u00f4te des Blancs is dedicated almost exclusively to Chardonnay.[2]\nThe unique, chalky landscape of the Champagne wine region and the resulting agro-industrial system\nled to the development of sparkling wines like champagne in the 17th century. As a result, many of the\nproduction sites and wine houses in the region were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in\n2015 as part the Champagne hillsides, houses and cellars site.[3]\nThe Champagne province is located near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel.\nThe high latitude and mean annual temperature of 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) creates a difficult environment for\nwine grapes to fully ripen.

This soil contributes to the\nlightness and finesse that is characteristic of Champagne wine. The Aube area is an exception with\npredominately clay based soil.[4] The chalk is also used in the construction of underground cellars that\ncan keep the wines cool through the bottle maturation process.[5]\nThe Carolingian reign saw periods of prosperity for the\nChampagne region beginning with Charlemagne's\nencouragement for the area to start planting vines and\ncontinuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at\nReims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed\nto the reputation of the wines that came from this area.[6] The\nCounts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent\ncounty from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count of\nChampagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France\nand the region became part of the Crown territories.\nThe location of Champagne played a large role in its historical\nprominence as it served as a \"crossroads\" for both military\nand trade routes. This also made the area open to devastation\nand destruction during military conflicts that were frequently\nwaged in the area. In 451 A.D. near Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne,\nAttila and the Huns were defeated by an alliance of Roman\nlegions, Franks and Visigoths.

The\nAbbey of Hautvillers, including its vineyards, was destroyed in 1560 during the War of Religion\nbetween the Huguenots and Catholics. This was followed by conflicts during the Thirty Year War and\nthe Fronde Civil War where soldiers and mercenaries held the area in occupation. It was not until the\n1660s, during the reign of Louis XIV, that the region saw enough peace to allow advances in sparkling\nwine production to take place.[8]\nThe region's reputation for wine production dates back to the\nMiddle Ages when Pope Urban II ( ruled 1088-1099 AD/CE ),\na native Champenois, declared that the wine of A\u00ff in the\nMarne d\u00e9partement was the best wine produced in the world.\nFor a time A\u00ff was used as a shorthand designation for wines\nfrom the entire Champagne region, similar to the use of\nBeaune for the wines of Burgundy.[9] The poet Henry\nd'Andeli's work La Bataille des Vins rated wines from the\ntowns of \u00c9pernay, Hautvillers and Reims as some of the best\nin Europe. As the region's reputation grew, popes and royalty\nsought to own pieces of the land with Pope Leo X, Francis I of\nFrance, Charles V of Spain, and Henry VIII of England all\nowning vineyard land in the region. A batch of wine from A\u00ff\nreceived in 1518 by Henry VIII's chancellor, Cardinal Thomas\nWolsey, is the first recorded export of wine from the\nChampagne region to England.[10]\nThe still wines of the area were highly prized in Paris under\nthe designation of vins de la rivi\u00e8re and vins de la montagne-\nwines of the river and wines of the mountain in reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne\nwhich carried the wines down to the Seine and into Paris.[11] The region was in competition with\nBurgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route\nfrom Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red\nwine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the\naddition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.[12]\nThe Champagne house of Gosset was founded as a still wine producer in 1584 and is the oldest\nChampagne house still in operation today. Ruinart was founded in 1729 and was soon followed by\nChanoine Fr\u00e8res (1730), Taittinger (1734), Mo\u00ebt et Chandon (1743) and Veuve Clicquot (1772).[10]\nThe nineteenth century saw an explosive growth in Champagne production going from a regional\nproduction of 300,000 bottles a year in 1800 to 20 million bottles in 1850.[13]\nA strong influence on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between the region\nand Burgundy.

As the King aged and his\nailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines,\nto soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress\nto oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's\ncontinuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal\ntable.[14]\nThis development had a ripple effect throughout both regions and in the Paris markets. Both\nChampagne and Burgundy were deeply concerned with the \"healthiness\" reputation of their wines,\neven to the extent of paying medical students to write theses touting the health benefit of their wines.\nThese theses were then used as advertising pamphlets that were sent to merchants and customers.\nThe Faculty of Medicine in Reims published several papers to refute Fagon's claim that Burgundy\nwine was healthier than Champagne. In response, Burgundian winemakers hired physician Jean-\nBaptiste de Salins, dean of the medical school in Beaune, to speak to a packed auditorium at the Paris\nFaculty of Medicine. Salins spoke favorably of Burgundy wine's deep color and robust nature and\ncompared it to the pale red color of Champagne and the \"instability\" of the wine to travel long\ndistances and the flaws of the bubbles from when secondary fermentation would take place. The text\nof his speech was published in newspapers and pamphlets throughout France and had a damaging\neffect on Champagne sales.[15]\nThe war of words would continue for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets,\nplaywrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in\nadvertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were on the brink\nof civil war.[16] A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to\nproduce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne.\nAs the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the\nhealth benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois\nwinemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy\nmellowed and eventually waned.[16]\nIn 1927, viticultural boundaries of Champagne were legally defined and split into five wine-producing\ndistricts: The Aube, C\u00f4te des Blancs, C\u00f4te de S\u00e9zanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vall\u00e9e de la Marne.\nThis area covered in 2008 33,500 hectares (76,000 acres) of vineyards around 319 villages that were\nhome to 5,000 growers who made their own wine and 14,000 growers who only sold grapes.[4][17][18]\nThe different districts produce grapes of varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne\nhouses to create their distinct house styles.

Champagne is the only region that is permitted to exclude AOC or Appellation\nd'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e from their labels.[4]\nFor each vintage, the CIVC rated the villages of the area based on the quality of their grapes and\nvineyards. The rating was then used to determine the price and the percentage of the price that\ngrowers get. The Grand Cru rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to\n100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90\u201399% ratings while Deuxi\u00e8me Crus received\n80\u201389% ratings.[2] Under appellation rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) of grapes can be\npressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either\n2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuv\u00e9e and the next 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior\nto 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage\nChampagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine is a blend\nof vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no\nregulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep\ntheir wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum\nof 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses\nkeep their wines on the lees throughout the entire aging period because it is more expensive to bottle\nthe wine before aging it, as opposed to bottling and shipping the product in a single step at the end of\nthe fermentation-and-aging process.[2]\nThe worldwide demand for Champagne has been continuously increasing throughout the 1990s and\nearly 2000s.

The allowed yield was\nincreased (to a maximum of 15,500\u00a0kg per hectare during an\nexperimental period from 2007 to 2011[20]) and the possibility\nof revising the production region was examined.\nAfter an extensive review of vineyard conditions in and\naround the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a\nproposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal\nwas prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of\nhistory, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy,\nworking from 2005.[21] The proposal means expanding the\nregion to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages.[17]\nThis is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages\nwhile simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne\ndepartment that were included in the 1927 regulations,\nGermaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.[22]\nThe proposed 40 new Champagne villages are located in four d\u00e9partements:[23][24]\n22 in Marne: Baslieux-les-Fismes, Blacy, Boissy-le-Repos, Bouvancourt, Breuil-sur-Vesle, Bussy-\nle-Repos, Champ\ufb02eury, Courlandon, Courcy, Courdemanges, Fismes, Huiron, La Ville-sous-\nOrbais, Le Thoult-Trosnay, Loivre, Montmirail, Mont-sur-Courville, Peas, Romain, Saint-Loup,\nSoulanges, and Ventelay.\n15 in Aube: Arrelles, Balnot-la-Grange, Bossancourt, Bouilly, \u00c9tourvy, Fontvannes, Javernant,\nLaines-aux-Bois, Macey, Messon, Prugny, Saint-Germain-l'\u00c9pine, Souligny, Torvilliers and Villery.\nTwo in Haute-Marne: Champcourt and Harricourt.\nOne, Marchais-en-Brie, in Aisne.\nThe INAO proposal was to be subject to review before being made into law and was immediately\nquestioned in numerous public comments. The mayor of one of the villages to be delisted, Germaine,\nimmediately appealed against INAO's proposal, with the possibility of additional appeals by vineyard\nowners.[17][25] The initial review process is expected to be finished by early 2009. This will be followed\nby another review of the specific parcels that will be added or deleted from the appellation. The\nearliest vineyard plantings are expected around 2015, with their product being marketed from around\n2021. However, the price of land that are allowed to be used for Champagne production is expected to\nimmediately rise from 5,000 to one million euro per hectare.\nWhile some critics have feared the revision of the Champagne region is about expanding production\nirrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson has pointed out that\nthe proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion. The villages under\ndiscussion are situated in gaps inside the perimeter of the existing Champagne regions rather than\noutside it.[21]\nAs of 2019, the expansion had not happened, with a final decision expected in 2023[26] or 2024.[27]\n5/22/25, 3:45 AM Champagne wine region - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_wine_region 6/9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3091, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c56113ce-2954-4393-abed-97c6e56d82e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c56113ce-2954-4393-abed-97c6e56d82e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Champagne wine region - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Champagne wine region - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 692071, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8dc2c5ca-8a3a-486b-8153-ab1dfc49b162", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Champagne wine region - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/Champagne wine region - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 692071, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "10baf991d32262cc340ee80a0aa83ebed6082433f80b9c92c72035cdc04496a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "While totally dominating the region's production, sparkling Champagne is not the only product that is\nmade from the region's grapes.
