Pruning creates an important distinction in the difference between wild\nvines and wine-producing grapes. Before long, the wines produced in Gaul were popular all around\nthe world.[4][5] The Roman Empire licensed regions in the south to produce wines. St. Martin of Tours\n(316\u2013397) spread Christianity and planted vineyards.[6] During the Middle Ages, monks maintained\nvineyards and, more importantly, conserved wine-making knowledge and skills during that often\nturbulent period. Monasteries had the resources, security and inventiveness to produce a steady\nsupply of wine for Mass and profit.[7] The best vineyards were owned by the monasteries and their\nwine was considered to be superior.[8] The nobility developed extensive vineyards but the French\nRevolution led to the confiscation of many vineyards.[9]\nThe advance of the French wine industry stopped abruptly as first mildew and then Phylloxera spread\nthroughout the country and the rest of Europe, destroying vineyards. Then came an economic\ndownturn in Europe, followed by two world wars; the French wine industry was depressed for\ndecades.[10] Competition threatened French brands such as Champagne and Bordeaux. This resulted\nin the establishment in 1935 of the Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e to protect French interests. Large\ninvestments, the economic revival after World War II and a new generation of vignerons yielded\nresults in the 1970s and the following decades, creating the modern French wine industry.[11]\nIn 1935, laws were passed to control the quality of French wine. The Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\nsystem was established, governed by a powerful oversight board (Institut national des appellations\nd'origine, INAO). France has one of the oldest systems for protected designation of origin for wine in\nthe world and strict laws concerning winemaking and production; many European systems are\nmodeled after it.[11][12] The word \"appellation\" has been put to use by other countries, sometimes in a\nmuch looser meaning. European Union wine laws have been modeled after those of the French.\nFrench law divides wine into four categories, two falling under the European Union Table Wine\ncategory and two the Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWPSR) designation. The\ncategories and their shares of the total French production for the 2005 vintage, excluding wine\ndestined for Cognac, Armagnac and other brandies, were\nTable wine:\nVin de Table (11.7%) \u2013 Carries with it only the producer and the designation that it is from France.\nVin de Pays (33.9%) \u2013 Carries with it a speci\ufb01c region within France (for example Vin de Pays\nd'Oc from Languedoc-Roussillon or Vin de Pays de C\u00f4tes de Gascogne from Gascony), and\nsubject to less restrictive regulations than AOC wines. For instance, it allows producers to\ndistinguish wines that are made using grape varieties or procedures other than those required by\nthe AOC rules, without having to use the simple and commercially non-viable table wine\nclassi\ufb01cation. In order to maintain a distinction from Vin de Table, the producers have to submit\nthe wine for analysis and tasting, and the wines have to be made from certain varieties or\nblends.[ 1 3 ] \nQWPSR:\nVin d\u00e9limit\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure (VDQS, 0.9%) \u2013 Less strict than AOC, usually used for smaller\nareas or as a \"waiting room\" for potential AOCs.

In\nyears with less favourable vintage conditions than 2005, the proportion of AOC wine tends to be a\nlittle lower. The proportion of Vin de table has decreased considerably over the last decades, while the\nproportion of AOC has increased somewhat and Vin de Pays has increased considerably. In 2005\nthere were 472 wine AOCs in France.[14]\nThe wine classification system of France was revised in 2006, with a new system fully introduced by\n2012. The newer system consists of three categories rather than four, with no category corresponding\nto VDQS. The new categories are:[15]\nVin de France, a table wine category, basically replacing Vin de Table, but allowing grape variety\nand vintage to be indicated on the label.\nIndication g\u00e9ographique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (IGP), an intermediate category, basically replacing Vin de\nPays.\nAppellation d'origine prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (AOP), the highest category, basically replacing AOC wines.\nThe largest changes were in the Vin de France category, and to VDQS wines, which either need to\nqualify as AOP wines or be downgraded to an IGP category. For the former AOC wines, the move to\nAOP involved only minor changes to the terminology of the label, while the actual names of the\nappellations themselves will remain unchanged.

An exception is French fortified\nwines, which tend to be relatively unknown outside France.\nIn many respects, French wines have more of a regional than a\nnational identity, as evidenced by different grape varieties,\nproduction methods and different classification systems in the\nvarious regions.

In fact, most of the so-called \"international varieties\" are of French origin, or\nbecame known and spread because of their cultivation in France.[12] Since French appellation rules\ngenerally restrict wines from each region, district or appellation to a small number of allowed grape\nvarieties, there are in principle no varieties that are commonly planted throughout all of France.\nMost varieties of grape are primarily associated with a certain region, such as Cabernet Sauvignon in\nBordeaux and Syrah in Rh\u00f4ne, although there are some varieties that are found in two or more\nregions, such as Chardonnay in Bourgogne (including Chablis) and Champagne, and Sauvignon blanc\nin Loire and Bordeaux. As an example of the rules, although climatic conditions would appear to be\nfavorable, no Cabernet Sauvignon wines are produced in Rh\u00f4ne, Riesling wines in Loire, or\nChardonnay wines in Bordeaux. If such wines were produced, they would have to be declassified to\nVin de Pays or French table wines; they would not be allowed to display any appellation name or even\nregion of origin.\nTraditionally, many French wines have been blended from several grape varieties.

As a minimum, labels will usually state that classification, as well as the\nname of the producer, and, for wines above the Vin De Table level, will also\ninclude the geographical area where the wine was made. Sometimes that will\nsimply be the wider region where the wine was made, but some labels,\nespecially for higher quality wines, will also include details of the individual\nvillage or commune, and even the specific vineyard where the wine was\nsourced. With the exception of wines from the Alsace region, France had no\ntradition of labelling wines with details of the grape varieties used. Since New\nWorld wines made the names of individual grape varieties familiar to international consumers in the\nlate 20th century, more French wineries started to use varietal labelling. In general, varietal labelling\nis most common for the Vin de Pays category, although some AOC wines now also display varietal\nnames. For most AOC wines, if grape varieties are mentioned, they will be in small print on a back\nlabel.\nLabels will also indicate where the wine was bottled, which can be an indication as to the quality level\nof the wine, and whether it was bottled by a single producer, or more anonymously and in larger\nquantities:\n\"Mis en bouteille ...\"[ 2 2 ] \n\"... au ch\u00e2teau, au domaine, \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9\": these have a similar meaning, and indicate the\nwine was \"estate bottled\", on the same property on which it was grown or at a cooperative\n(within the boundary of the appellation) of which that property is a member.\n\"... par ...\" the wine was bottled by the concern whose name follows. This may be the\nproducing vineyard or it may not.\n\"... dans la r\u00e9gion de production\": the wine was not bottled at the vineyard but by a larger\nbusiness at its warehouse; this warehouse was within the same winemaking region of France\nas the appellation, but not necessarily within the boundary of the appellation itself. If a chateau\nor domaine is named, it may well not exist as a real vineyard, and the wine may be an\nassemblage from the grapes or the wines of several producers.\n\"... dans nos chais, dans nos caves\": the wine was bottled by the business named on the label.\n\"Vigneron ind\u00e9pendant\" is a special mark adopted by some independent wine-makers, to\ndistinguish them from larger corporate winemaking operations and symbolize a return to the\nbasics of the craft of wine-making. Bottles from these independent makers carry a special logo\nusually printed on the foil cap covering the cork.\nIf varietal names are displayed, common EU rules apply:[23]\nIf a single varietal name is used, the wine must be made from a minimum of 85% of this variety.\nIf two or more varietal names are used, only the displayed varieties are allowed.\nLabelling practices\n5/22/25, 3:43 AM French wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_wine 7/14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3277, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e37568ef-aa13-49c9-90a2-e1962f7a89ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "e37568ef-aa13-49c9-90a2-e1962f7a89ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 862568, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "827b8cf7-9b05-48a1-af80-87f35be93f63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 862568, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "714244b440c7e69a3fabbfb1e3f66e30acc8841b60da1a31ebd4421130759008", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Map of the principal wine regions in France\nIf two or more varietal names are used, they must generally appear in descending order.\nThe recognized wine-producing areas in France are\nregulated by the Institut National des Appellations\nd'Origine (INAO).

Gamay is\ncharacterized by an early ripening and acidic variety. Due to the carbonic maceration that producers\nuse during the wine-making process Beaujolais wines are brightly colored with a low level of soft\ntannin. They usually have an intense fruity flavor of raspberry and cranberry.

White wines are also sometimes made from Aligot\u00e9, and other grape varieties will also be\nfound occasionally.\nBrittany\nBurgundy\n5/22/25, 3:43 AM French wine - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_wine 9/14", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2459, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1efdc68d-bc7d-4392-ac90-36d25f22471b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1efdc68d-bc7d-4392-ac90-36d25f22471b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 862568, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2517c5b-5310-4e36-9f73-383abc0a6931", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_path": "data/French wine - Wikipedia.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 862568, "creation_date": "2025-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-22"}, "hash": "9f406d2d73f6a901a36d9c7c97fef047f47aa3a23de5088657045f0b593afa66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Gustave Henri Laly, a renowned wine producer from Burgundy, supplied the French General\nAssembly with his Montrachet produced at Mont Dardon around the turn of the 20th century.\nChampagne, situated in northeastern France, close to Belgium and Luxembourg, is the coldest of\nFrance's major wine regions and home to its major sparkling wine.

However, wine consumption has\nbeen dropping in France for 40 years. During the decade of the 1990s, per capita consumption\ndropped by nearly 20 percent. Therefore, French wine producers must rely increasingly on foreign\nmarkets. However, consumption has also been dropping in other potential markets such as Italy,\nSpain and Portugal.\nThe result has been a continuing wine glut, often called the wine lake. This has led to the distillation of\nwine into industrial alcohol as well as a government program to pay farmers to pull up their grape\nvines through vine pull schemes. A large part of this glut is caused by the re-emergence of Languedoc\nwine.\nImmune from these problems has been the market for champagne as well as the market for the\nexpensive ranked or classified wines.
