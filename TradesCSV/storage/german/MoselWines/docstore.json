The area is known for the steep slopes\nof the region's vineyards overlooking the river. At 65\u00b0 degrees incline, the steepest recorded vineyard\nin the world is the Calmont vineyard located on the Mosel and belonging to the village of Bremm, and\ntherefore referred to as Bremmer Calmont.[4][5] The Mosel is mainly famous for its wines made from\nthe Riesling grape, but Elbling and M\u00fcller-Thurgau also contribute to the production, among others.\nIn the past two decades red wine production, especially from the Sp\u00e4tburgunder (Pinot noir), has\nincreased in the Mosel and throughout the German wine-growing regions and has become of\nincreasing interest to the international wine community.[6] Because of the northerly location of the\nMosel, the Riesling wines are often light, tending to lower alcohol, crisp and high in acidity, and often\nexhibit \"flowery\" rather than or in addition to \"fruity\" aromas. Its most common vineyard soil is\nderived in the main from various kinds of slate deposits, which tend to give the wines a transparent,\nmineralic aspect, that often exhibit great depth of flavor.[7] In the current era of climate change much\nwork has been done to improve and gain acceptance for completely dry (\"Trocken\") Rieslings in this\nregion, so that most of the more famous makers have found acceptance for such wines, particularly in\nEurope.[8]\nIt is believed that viticulture was brought to this area by the Romans who planted vineyards along the\nMosel and the Rhine in order to have a local source of wine for their garrisons. The cost of\ntransporting wine up from the Italian Peninsula or across the Vosges Mountains and the Roman\nvineyards in Gaul was very high and impractical. The Romans considered creating a canal between the\nSa\u00f4ne and the Rhine before ultimately deciding to plant vines in the area. Trier (founded 16 BC) was a\nmajor Roman outpost and it is likely that the first Mosel vineyards were planted in the surrounding\nhillsides sometime in the 2nd century. Viticulture was certainly flourishing in the area by the 4th\ncentury when the Roman poet Ausonius wrote a poem about the beauty of the land at harvest time.[9]\nHistory\n6/20/25, 10:47 AM Mosel (wine region) - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosel_(wine_region) 1/9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3018, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aed35142-d2a8-4c37-9fac-08a9473277d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "aed35142-d2a8-4c37-9fac-08a9473277d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "MoselWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/MoselWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 777208, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e01b9ba-f5c6-4600-9fd5-3d6177f6cd80", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "MoselWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/MoselWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 777208, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "hash": "b58ec25e3d06a9f74cea31af87062338291f0949cf4a5876faeb5c383e337c6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Roman Porta Nigra was one of four\ncity gates around Trier.\nThe wine village Bernkastel in 1646 (upper\npicture)\nThe Mosel wine of the Roman period was described as light\nbodied and \"austere\". It was said to be an easier drinking wine\nthan that of other Roman areas. In the winter time, the wine\nwas heated in a kettle and drunk like a tea (a practice that still\nhas some tradition among modern vineyard workers who\ndrink it like coffee, often with a little sugar added). In warmer\nvintages the wine was noticeably more fruity and sweet. This\nwas because the warmth allowed the grapes to more fully\nripen and develop more sugars. During the cold autumn the\nfermentation process would not be fully complete because of\nthe low temperature, thus leaving the wine with high levels of\nresidual sugars.[10]\nIn the Middle Ages, villages sprung up that were centered on\nthe region's wine industry. These \"wine villages\", known as\n\"Winzerd\u00f6rfer\", included paths from the town center up to\nthe area's vineyards. At the center was a community wine\ncellar where all the area's growers could store their wines.\nProbably most well known among the Winzerd\u00f6rfer was the\nvillage of Bernkastel which was granted town rights in\n1291.[10] In 1435 when Count Johann IV of Katzenelnbogen\nplanted Riesling[11] in the nearby town of R\u00fcsselsheim the\nfirst time he owned vineyards in Winningen like the Destil,\nin Burgen and Kochem one half of the city and many\nvineyards more along the Mosel. In order to create more\nsuitable land for vineyards, vineyard owners in the 16th\ncentury used explosives to break up the vertical spurs of rock\nalong the rivers.[12]\nTowards the end of the 17th century, the Kunda began to be\nidentified more with wine made from the Riesling grape. The\nSt. Maximin's Abbey in Trier owned 74 vineyards and by\n1695 had over 100,000 Riesling vines. Today the vineyard of\nMaximin Gr\u00fcnhaus is considered one of the best Riesling\nvineyards in all of Germany. In the 18th century, the Prince-\nelector of Trier, Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, mandated\nthat over a seven-year period every vine in the Mosel area was to be Riesling only. The rise of the\nHouse of Hanover in Great Britain saw a period of increase exportation of \"moselle wine\" to England.\nHowever, the wine's high price kept the wines mostly in the hands of the Royal court and English\nnobility rather than replacing claret in the village taverns.[13]\nThe 19th century saw an unprecedented era of prosperity for the Mosel wine industry under the rule of\nPrussia starting with the historic vintage of 1819. For the rest of the 1820s, there was a succession of\noutstanding weather and sterling wines produced. To promote the region's wine, the Prussian\ngovernment lowered the tariffs for the import of Mosel wines to other regions of the Prussian\nkingdom.

A string\nof bad weather vintages in the late 1830s and early 1840s would dampen the extent of prosperity that\nthe Mosel would see.[14]\nBy the 1850s, wine-makers in the Mosel had discovered the benefits of chaptalization in helping to\ncompensate for bad weather vintages and under ripened grapes. Another significant boom came a\ncouple decades later when the British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone lowered the duties on\nlight wine which opened up the British market to lower cost Mosel wines. This increased prosperity\nhad the net effect of encouraging more quantity in production rather than quality. Many areas that\nwere not ideal for Riesling were soon planted with the easier to grow M\u00fcller-Thurgau and other\nRiesling crossings. In the 20th century, a North American taste for sweet wines saw the prominence of\nLiebfraumilch and brands like Blue Nun dominate the German import wine market. In recent times,\nthe Mosel (as well as the entire German wine industry) has dedicated itself to reversing the reputation\nit gained during these years and focus on the quality of the area's dry wines.[14]\nThe Mosel wine region has northernly continental climate that\nis marked by cool temperatures. The best producing vineyard\nsites are located along the Mosel river and its tributary where\nthe heat from the sun can be maximized by reflection up from\nthe water. South and southwest facing slopes are even more\nsought after because of the increased exposure to direct\nsunlight that can aid in ripening of the grapes.[15] The soil of\nthe area is dominated by porous slate which has ideal drainage\nfor the regions heavy rainfall and good heat retaining\nproperties.[3] Many of the best vineyards have no topsoil at all,\njust broken slate. During the summer months the weather is\nwarm but rarely hot with July's average temperatures around\n64\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C).[12]\nThe Mosel river dominates the geography of the region which is typically divided into three main\nsections. The Upper Mosel is the southernmost section located closest to the river's origins along the\nFrench and Luxembourg border. The region includes the Saar and Ruwer river tributaries and is\ncentered on the city of Trier. The Middle Mosel or Mittelmosel is the main wine growing region and\nincludes the villages of Bernkastel and Piesport. The Middle Mosel begins at the village of Zell and\nextends south to just north of the village of Schweich. The slate-based soil here is said to have one of\nthe most recognizable terroir with the wines, especially Riesling, displaying slatey mineral notes. The\nLower Mosel includes the region south of the city of Koblenz to the village of Alf near Zell. It is the\nmost northern wine region of the Mosel and includes the area's confluence with the Rhine river.[15]\nClimate and geography\n6/20/25, 10:47 AM Mosel (wine region) - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosel_(wine_region) 3/9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3020, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1fcc35b-1b06-4548-a075-1f647aed261f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1fcc35b-1b06-4548-a075-1f647aed261f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "MoselWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/MoselWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 777208, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c12a0101-927f-4823-8a90-f419a04fd9b9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "MoselWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/MoselWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 777208, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "hash": "57b1a3df3d2399a5fc079f58667c496b675fb785dd7fca234b9684f3e1731aa4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Terraced vineyards along the bank of the\nMosel in Trittenheim.\nRiesling grapes.\nThe steep river bank slopes that are scattered around the\nMosel region are considered some of the most labor-intensive\nvineyards in the world. Mechanical harvesting is impractical\nand nearly seven times more man hours are needed in the\nMosel than in flatter terrain such as the M\u00e9doc.[16] Grapevines\nare individually staked to the ground without connecting wires\nso that vineyard workers can tend the plants going\nhorizontally across the vineyard rather than vertically, which\nwould be more treacherous and tiring. Safety is a priority for\nmany Mosel vineyard owners with the area having a\ndocumented history of fatalities among workers while tending\nthe vines.[3] A benefit of the steep Mosel vineyards is that the incline allows for more direct sunlight to\nhave contact with the vines. During the winter, rain often causes some soil erosion, especially of the\nvital slate chips that are needed for their heat retaining properties. Many vineyards will gather these\neroded sediments and carry them back up the hillside.[5]\nThe Riesling grape, grown on 59.7% of the region's cultivated\nvineyard surface in 2008,[17] is widely considered the most\nprestigious and highest quality wine grape of the Mosel but it\ncannot be planted on every vineyard site due to difficulties the\ngrape has in ripening in particularly cool climates. Factors\nsuch as altitude, aspect and sunlight exposure can have a\npronounced effect not only on the resulting quality of the wine\nbut also whether the Riesling grape will even ripen at all. A\npositive characteristic of the Riesling grape is that despite less\nthan perfect ripeness it can still create a wine of finesse and\nelegance that would escape most other grape varieties.[5]\nIn place of Riesling, the easier cultivated M\u00fcller-Thurgau grape (14.7%) and other Riesling crossings\nlike Kerner (4.6%) were planted in large quantities on the sites that were not suitable for Riesling, and\nwhich in many cases had been previously used for other agricultural purposes. A negative\nconsequence of these large-scale plantings is that the wine produced from these sites are typically of a\nlower quality than Riesling wines which in turn has a depressing economic effect on the prices of all\nMosel wines. While consumers have benefited with top quality Riesling wines being underpriced in\ncomparison with some of the world's other great wines from places like Bordeaux, Burgundy and\nCalifornia, the economic hardship created by the prices has caused some of the smaller Mosel\nvineyards to go out of business.[3]\nIn 2008, the Mosel vineyards covered 9,034 hectares (22,320 acres), making it the fifth-largest of\nGermany's 13 wine regions.[17] White grape varieties cover 91 percent of the region's total vineyard\nsurface. The trend in total vineyard area has until recently been slightly negative over a longer period\nof time, down from 12,760 hectares (31,500 acres) in 1988 to 9,533 hectares (23,560 acres) in\n2003[18] and to 8,975 hectares (22,180 acres) in 2006.[19] It is primarily lesser sites previously planted\nViticulture\n6/20/25, 10:47 AM Mosel (wine region) - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosel_(wine_region) 4/9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3232, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fddb207e-407b-4866-a4c3-7435d5f89707": {"__data__": {"id_": "fddb207e-407b-4866-a4c3-7435d5f89707", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "MoselWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/MoselWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 777208, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0fedbdab-a75e-4537-92f3-3c28a03d6975", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "MoselWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/MoselWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 777208, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "hash": "a1f46c58a517d02b0030c98d4e8ad4372aea20714bffcdfa04909faeed421820", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A Kabinett level German Riesling from\nthe village of Graach, located between\nBernkastel and Wehlen.\nBernkastel-Kues\nwith \"low quality\" varieties that have been abandoned in this process; during the 20-year period from\n1988 to 2008, plantings of M\u00fcller-Thurgau decreased by 55% and those of Elbling by 49%.

This district\nproduces a higher proportion of dry wines than the rest of the region. A well known vineyard from this\narea is the Juffermauer located near Treis-Karden, whose name means \"Virgin-Wall\" in the local\nFranconian dialect/language.[20]\nDistrict Bernkastel / more commonly known as Mittelmosel\nThis is the central district of the region. One of the most notable vineyards in this area is known as\nDoctorberg, and its wines as Bernkasteler Doctor. An apocryphal story of how the vineyard got its\nname originated in the late Middle Ages when a local archbishop was miraculously cured of a terminal\nillness by drinking wine made from the grapes of this vineyard.[21]\nOther notable vineyards of the Mittelmosel include the Sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards;\nBrauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large\nsundials were built in these vineyards so that the workers would know what time to break for lunch or\nthe end of the work day.

The Ruwer is an estuary that \ufb02ows into the Mosel; \"Tal\"\nis German for valley.)\nLocated to the southeast of Trier, this region includes the\nvineyards around Waldrach and Kasel. The region is home to\nmany vineyards in Alleinbesitz (monopole). At Mertesdorf,\nthere is a subterranean Roman aqueduct that connects the\nGr\u00fcnhaus vineyard with the city of Trier. The quality of Ruwer\nwine is particularly dependent on the quality of the vintage\nwith cool vintages marked by sharply acidic wines that quickly\nfade and warmer vintage producing some of the most delicate\nand perfumed expressions of German wines.[22]\nDistrict Saar\nLike the Ruwer region, wine from the Saar district (along the\nlower course of the Saar River, in Rhineland-Palatinate) is\nparticularly dependent on the overall quality of the vintage\ntypically only 4 years out of every 10 producing a worthwhile\nset of wines. The wines that do come out of these warm\nvintages are noted for their apple-like freshness and steely\nmineral notes. The most ideal vintages allow harvest to take\nplace between late October and mid November when the\ngrapes can develop enough sugar to produce floral and\nhoneyed notes.[22]\nDistrict Obermosel\nThis wine district is composed of a thin strip of land along the Luxembourg border. The region starts\njust north of Igel and continues south to the village of Palzem where it meets the Moseltor district.\nElbling, M\u00fcller-Thurgau, and Auxerrois Blanc are some of the region largest plantings.[22] Obermosel\nand Moseltor contain very few notable vineyards compared to the other districts of the region.\nDistrict Moseltor\nThe Moseltor area is the most southern area of the Mosel region, and is located together with the\nObermosel along the Luxembourg border. The Elbling grape is the most commonly planted here\nproducing a thin, rustic wine with high acidity. Sparkling wine production is growing in this area.[22]\nThe reason why tiny Moseltor with its around 110 hectares (270 acres) of vineyards is a separate\nBereich is that it, in contrast to the other 99% of Mosel's vineyard area, is located in the state of\nSaarland, and therefore is supervised by this state's government.

The wines of the Mosel\nregion are traditionally packaged in a long green colored \"hock style\" wine\nbottle. Historically the green color distinguished Mosel wines from the brown\nbottles of the Rheinhessen.[5]\nPlantings of M\u00fcller-Thurgau accounts for more the 20% of the Mosel wine\nproduction and is typically used for basic quaffing wine or sweet wine. The\nElbing grape accounts for a little more than 9% of the area's production and is\noften used as a low-cost riesling alternative in the production of sparkling Sekt. The Mosel is also well\nknown for its Eiswein production with the area's characteristic high acidity coupled with the\nsweetness produced by the concentration of the sugars in the frozen grapes.[5]\nThe most cultivated grape varieties, by area in 2008, were:[24]\nRiesling, 5,390 ha (59.7%)\nM\u00fcller-Thurgau, 1,263 ha (14.0%)\nElbling, 567 ha (6.3%)\nKerner, 377 ha (4.2%)\nSp\u00e4tburgunder, 359 ha (4.0%)\nDornfelder, 333 ha (3.7%)\nWei\u00dfer Burgunder, 248 ha (2.7%)\nBacchus, 84 ha (0.9%)\nGrauer Burgunder, 83 ha (0.9%)\nRegent, 61 ha (0.7%)\nChardonnay, 35 ha (0.4%)\nAuxerrois, 28 ha (0.3%)\nReichensteiner, 26 ha (0.3%)\nOrtega, 20 ha (0.2%)\nThere are two major wine growers' associations in the Mosel region, the Gro\u00dfer Ring, which is a\nregional section of the VDP, and the Bernkasteler Ring. They both arrange annual wine auctions of\ntop wines. Producers can submit their wines to the VDP for taste testing to qualify as reserve wines\nknown as Erste Lage (meaning first site).
