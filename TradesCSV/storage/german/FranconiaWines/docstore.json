To the southeast of theregion lies Steigerwald.\nRed grapes along the\"Franconian red wine footpath\",a long-distance hiking trail\nThe Maindreieck in bird's-eyeview\nFranconia (wine region)\nFranconia (German: Franken) is a German wine region,[1] mostly in north west Franconia. It is the onlywine region in the federal state of Bavaria. In 2014, vines were grown on 6,176 hectares (15,260 acres) ofland in the region.[2]\nThe greater part of the wine region is in Lower Franconia around its capital W\u00fcrzburg along the Main River.There are a few areas in Middle Franconia, mainly in the Steigerwald; and a very small part in the area ofUpper Franconia around Bamberg. The bends of the River Main have been used to define the region's threedistricts, two of which take their names from their respective geometric shape.[3]\nThe Mainviereck (\"Main square\") is the westernmost district of Franconia, on the lower slopes of theSpessart hills and is one of the warmest spots in Bavaria. The special soil is mainly red sandstone which isespecially suitable for growing grape vines for red wine. Franconian vine plantings for red wine started toexpand in the 1970s.[4]\nThe Pinot noirs and the rare but high quality grape Fr\u00fchburgunder are grown. The \"B\u00fcrgstadter Centgrafenberg\" and the\"Schlossberg\" in Klingenberg am Main are said to be the best vineyards. Some of the wines made from vines grown therehave won national and international wine trophies. The most important villages are B\u00fcrgstadt, Gro\u00dfheubach andKlingenberg am Main.\nThe main red wine areas of Franconia have been connected by the long-distance hiking trail Fr\u00e4nkischerRotweinwanderweg (Franconian red wine footpath) since 1990.\nThe Maindreieck (\"Main triangle\") is the middle portion of Franconia. On the sometimes very steep hills alongside theMain river, the soil mainly consists of Muschelkalk. Mostly Silvaner and M\u00fcller-Thurgau grapes are grown. As in manywine regions in Germany, a wide variety of grapes are cultivated. Riesling, Bacchus, Pinot noir, Domina, and Dornfelderare the most important grapes besides Silvaner and M\u00fcller-Thurgau. Some wine journalists say that Franconia is the onlyplace in the world where the wines made from Silvaner can be better than those made there from Riesling.[5]\nThe best-known vineyard site is the W\u00fcrzburger Stein, a hill north of central W\u00fcrzburg. The wines from there are knownas Steinwein. Along the Maindreieck, nearly every town produces some wine. The earliest evidence of the Silvaner grapeis found in the archive of Castell in a document from 10 April 1659.\nThe most important cities and towns are W\u00fcrzburg, Randersacker, Th\u00fcngersheim,Sommerhausen, Frickenhausen amMain, Sulzfeld am Main, Sommerach, Escherndorf, Nordheim, and Volkach.\nThe soil of the Mittelgebirge Steigerwald consists mainly of gypsum. The wines of this region often have a very strong mineral taste. The most importantvillages are Iphofen, R\u00f6delsee and Castell\nThere is evidence that wine has been produced in Franconia for over 1,000 years. In an old document from the year 777 there is a note of a winery in thetown of Hammelburg being given by Charlemagne to Fulda Abbey. In medieval times the area under cultivation grew strongly, up to 40,000 ha. In the20th century it decreased at one stage to just over 2,000 ha.\nToday about 6,100 ha of land is used for growing wine. The area stretches from Bamberg to Aschaffenburg.

Therefore, wine is grown mainly inespecially protected places usually along the hills of the River Main and the Steigerwald.\nBecause of the special soil and the mild climate along the Main river, wines with a very high mineralisation can be harvested. The amount of minerals inthe wine is a factor in the quality testing every Franconian wine is subjected to. This is unique in Germany. The majority of the wines are made from onegrape variety at a time. Cuv\u00e9es \u2013 special blends or selected vats of higher quality \u2013 are rare.

Although in German law dry wines are allowed 9\u00a0grams of residual sugar, manyGerman wineries are still using the term Fr\u00e4nkisch trocken (Franconian dry) for wines with 5\u00a0grams of residualsugar or less. About 12,000 to 14,000 wines from Franconia pass the official testing.\nAs in most German wine regions, the exact vineyard site (Lage) where the wine comes from is nearly as importantas the winery. Apart from the Steinwein, very few people outside Franconia \u2013 and nearly no one outside Germany\u2013 is familiar with the site names, mainly because the German Lagen are tiny compared to some of the well-knownappellations of France, Italy, and Spain. Today many wineries have tried to introduce their own brands without thevineyard designation, and with cuv\u00e9es a brand name rather than a single grape varietal.\nFranconian wines vary in how long they can be kept. The basic wines, which are called Qualit\u00e4tswein or Kabinettare made to be drunk one to three years after production. If they are kept too long, the wines lose their typicalfruitiness and freshness. The best wines are mainly the dry Sp\u00e4tlesen which are full-bodied and can mature for upto six, sometimes ten years. The rare sweet wines often with noble rot, and Eisweins, can sometimes mature for 50years or more. Oak matured red wines should be drunk three to ten years after production if kept in a good winecellar.\nOriginally the Silvaner was the most important grape. In the 20th century the M\u00fcller-Thurgau, a simple grape, has been planted in large areas. Althoughthe amount of M\u00fcller Thurgau has been decreasing for the last ten years, it is still the most widely cultivated grape in Franconia.\nRed grape varieties cover 20% of the region's vineyard area.[2]\nThe most cultivated grape varieties, by area in 2022, were:[6]\nwhite area (share) red area (share)\nSilvaner 1,560 ha (24.9%) Domina 299 ha (4.8%)\nM\u00fcller-Thurgau 1,414 ha (22.5%) Sp\u00e4tburgunder 293 ha (4.7%)\nBacchus 744 ha (11.9%) Dornfelder 131 ha (2.1%)\nRiesling 346 ha (5.5%) Regent 125 ha (2.0%)\nWei\u00dfer Burgunder 230 ha (3.7%) Schwarzriesling 63 ha (1.0%)\nScheurebe 203 ha (3.2%) Schwarzriesling 79 ha (1.3%)\nKerner 157 ha (2.5%) Acolon 47 ha (0.7%)\nPinot gris 106 ha (1.7%) Portugieser 44 ha (0.7%)\nThe rounded and flattened Bocksbeutel is the typical and well known bottle originally used only for the bestFranconian wines. Since 1989 the use of the Bocksbeutel has been protected by European Union regulations,but some other regions beside Franconia are also allowed to use this bottle shape.\nUnlike many other German wine regions, a large amount of Franconian wine is drunk in the area where it isproduced. Nearly every town has its own Weinfest, a festival that lasts a weekend, or sometimes just one day,where wine is drunk instead of beer. The so-called Heckenwirtschaften are very popular small outlets wherewineries sell their own wine, usually at reasonable prices.\nFranconian Wine Queen\n1.
