In terms\nof natural regions it is considered to be a part of the Upper\nRhine Plain.\nThe name \"Kaiserstuhl\" is believed to refer to King Otto\nIII, who held court near Sasbach on 22 December 994.\nFrom then on, the whole hill range was called the\nK\u00f6nigsstuhl \u2013 the King's Chair. In May 996, Otto III was\ncrowned Emperor and the King's Chair eventually became\nthe Emperor's Chair \u2013 \"Kaiserstuhl\". Reliable sources\nmention the name Kaiserstuhl only as early as 1304 and\nhistorians thus suppose that the term Kaiserstuhl was not\ncoined until the 13th century.\nThe Kaiserstuhl is situated in South Baden, mainly in\nBreisgau-Hochschwarzwald county or district. However,\nthe smaller northern part belongs to Emmendingen.\nWithin the Upper Rhine Plain it is situated about 16\u00a0km\nnorthwest of the city of Freiburg, right next to the eastern\nbank of the Rhine and a short distance west of the\nDreisam. It reaches up to 377\u00a0metres above the level of the\nRhine downstream (179.5\u00a0m a.s.l.) from the weir close to\nBurkheim.\nAt its greatest extent, from the Michaelsberg near Riegel\nin the northeast, to the Fohrenberg, by Ihringen in the\nsouthwest, the Kaiserstuhl is about 15\u00a0km long.

During the formation of the Upper Rhine Plain this\npart of the Kaiserstuhl sloped less in respect to its surrounding area \u2013 and thus appears as a so-called horst.\nIn terms of its geological structure and the sequence of its escarpments, the Kaiserstuhl is comparable to the\nnearby Tuniberg, Nimberg and also to the Sch\u00f6nberg, which is situated south of the city of Freiburg.\nPetrologically the volcanic Kaiserstuhl is an alkali-carbonate rock\nformation. The volcanic rocks making up a large part of the central\nand western Kaiserstuhl were the result of numerous volcanic\neruptions during the Miocene, about 19 to 16 million years ago. They\ncover parts of the sedimentary base of the eastern Kaiserstuhl, which\nis why in some places changes in the base's mineralogical\ncomposition occurred. The driving force behind this process of\ncontact metamorphism was an increase in temperature. Due to the\nalternate eruption of tephra and lava flows from several vents a\ncomplex stratovolcano came into existence. Some of the rising\nmagma solidified as volcanic intrusions below the surface \u2013 and\ntoday forms the central part of the Kaiserstuhl. Laterally rising\nphonolite magma also intruded into the sedimentary base of the\nEastern Kaiserstuhl. Several hundred metres of the original volcano have been eroded.\nThe entire volcanic Kaiserstuhl consists of rock types that contain\nfeldspathoid minerals and olivine and are undersaturated with SiO2.\nMost igneous rocks at the surface are leucite-tephrites, with\nsubordinate phonolites, limburgites, and olivine-nephelinites (at the\nLimberg Mountain near Sasbach), the last of which is rich in\nxenoliths from the Earth's mantle. Carbonatite ignimbrite and lapilli\nare local peculiarities; they can be found in places in the western part\nof the Kaiserstuhl (Henkenberg near Burkheim, Kirchberg near\nOberrotweil).\nThe subvolcanic and intrusive rocks of the central Kaiserstuhl are\nplutonic equivalents of the erupted material (essexite, carbonatite\nand coarse-granular phonolite). Several local terms which do not carry official status with the International\nUnion of Geological Sciences have been used for different varieties of the intrusive rocks. Of major scientific\ninterest is the consolidated carbonatite near Altvogtsburg und Schelingen. It is a quite rare volcanic rock,\nwhich crystallized from a carbonate magmatic melt rather than a silicate one. Given its unusual composition\nfor an igneous rock, the magmatic nature of the carbonatite was not proposed for a long time and remained\ndoubtful subsequently. An alternative interpretation was that it was a metamorphically altered sedimentary\nrock, examples of which can be found nearby. Only in the 1950s and 1960s did research prove that it was a\ncarbonatite; one of the clues was identification of the eruptive carbonatites found in the western part of the\nKaiserstuhl. The carbonatite contains the niobium rich pyrochlore; attempts to mine the carbonatite rock for\nniobium were carried out in the middle of the 20th century, but the amount turned out to be too small to be\neconomical.\nVolcanic activity\nVolcanic rocks\n6/20/25, 10:48 AM Kaiserstuhl (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiserstuhl_(Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) 3/8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3389, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc24b496-b29f-4b8c-b81e-baa794f21362": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc24b496-b29f-4b8c-b81e-baa794f21362", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 730880, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42ddab70-c3c9-4429-8d80-3a03b7ea02ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 730880, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "hash": "d37a4d006263a9b57a01dc890c8de92f205560560768d40da80d9d836dc01664", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Loess alley near Vogtsburg-\nBickensohl, Kaiserstuhl\nFor a long time the Kaiserstuhl has been known for rare minerals. Examples include the quarries at the\nLimberg (zeolites), Badberg (carbonatites), Orberg and Fohberg. Well-crystallized minerals can be found\npredominantly in clefts or cavities in the volcanic rock.\nThe Kaiserstuhl is today largely covered by a Quaternary loess layer, a loosely\ncemented sediment. It is derived from other rocks through erosion and is then\ntransported by the wind. The loess at the Kaiserstuhl \u2013 as in all the peripheral\nareas of the Upper Rhine Valley \u2013 was formed during the last Ice Age. Large\nparts were bare of vegetation and so loess was winnowed out from the Rhine\nsediments. It was then deposited in the periglacial area (i.e. ice-free, but\nsurrounded by glaciers) at the Kaiserstuhl. The major process active here was\nfrost weathering resulting in crushed rocks. The wind blew strongly, as there\nwas no vegetation that could have moderated it \u2013 entraining the lightest\nmaterial and depositing it at obstacles like the Kaiserstuhl. Deposition took\nplace northeast of the Kaiserstuhl, as the winds blew from the southwest.\nThe higher the place of sedimentation, the thinner the layer of the sedimented\nmaterial is. At the Kaiserstuhl the thickness of the loess layer varies between\n10 and 40 metres. There are, however, also areas in the southwest where no\nloess has been deposited. The Northern Limestone Alps are considered the\nmain source of the Kaiserstuhl loess. A rust-coloured band occurs at irregular\nintervals. It developed as a new material and did not arrive regularly but in\nphases of different intensities. In a phase of weak sedimentation the material on top weathered \u2013 and the\ncalcium carbonate was washed out. It then precipitated further down and formed a particular type of soil\nhorizon, which contains concretions of calcium carbonate.\nThe Kaiserstuhl loess soils are used for intensive farming, as they offer good aeration, high water storage\ncapacities and good mechanical qualities. Besides, as a result of farming deep narrow ravine-like paths\ndeveloped.\nAs the loess developed over time it is, furthermore, significant for flood control. Sponge-like, it absorbs and\nthen gently releases rainfall. This quality is however lost when bulldozers, employed to construct large\nterraces for viticulture, compress the loess.\nThe Kaiserstuhl is one of the warmest regions in Germany. Its location in the southwestern corner of\nGermany and the protection of the mountains give it a warm microclimate, which is influenced mostly by air\nfrom the western Mediterranean Sea blowing through the Burgundian Gate. Atlantic air masses can raise the\ntemperatures especially in winter as well, while the surrounding mountains are able to hold most of the\nprecipitation away from Kaiserstuhl. This is why the Region features nearly 2,100 sunshine hours and only\naround 500 milliliters of precipitation a year, while the nearby Black Forest has levels up to 2,000 milliliters\na year.\nMinerals\nLoess\nClimate\nGeneral\n6/20/25, 10:48 AM Kaiserstuhl (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiserstuhl_(Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) 4/8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3187, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a73eccec-b2fa-4548-9a47-690e31239ee8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a73eccec-b2fa-4548-9a47-690e31239ee8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 730880, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e6451ba-4b54-4185-91f7-0135a44e271a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 730880, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "hash": "6524ae76331233b6dcb5a5e40b926015e4e1a46c342c7cd3ba1e41c2bdd1b9fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "042fbf0e-02b6-4e6b-b1c5-2ac6e9655b0b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0dcde0b53fad1e3593e2bd445deb5ba2b6dcdd35eb55d35a9ce1fa941c12a489", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Exotic fruits like kakis can be\ngrown in the region's warm\nclimate\nWinters are short and mild, although light night frost can occur especially in\nJanuary.

This species has a disjunct distribution, which means away from\nits normal habitat. It is a relict of a postglacial warm period where there had\nbeen a much warmer climate around the Kaiserstuhl. After the end of the\nwarm period only the named species were able to survive. Besides there is a\nlarger population of the May beetle (Melolontha melolontha). In spite of\nprotests from conservationists the May Beetle is controlled by the use of\ninsecticides.\nIn the centre of the Kaiserstuhl between the Vogt Burger districts of\nSchelingen and Oberbergen and the somewhat remote eastern community of\nEichstetten lies two direct neighbouring natural Designated Conservation Areas (DCA), the DCA Badberg\n(DCA No. 81345), which was established in 1969, is 65 hectares high and has many rare plants (e.g. Orchids),\nand the eastern add-on DCA Haselschacher Buck (DCA no. 163542) which was founded in 1989 and is 71.3\nhectares in size. Furthermore, in Kaiserstuhl there is a large number of small Designated Conservation Areas.\nThe bigger part, in particular in its centre belongs to the Fauna Flora Habitat area of the Kaiserstuhl (FFH no.\n7911\u2013341).\nThe Kaiserstuhl and its surrounding area is a region of intense wine growing. Wines from the Kaiserstuhl\nhave achieved an excellent reputation which has by now become international. The bigger part of the\navailable area is covered with vineyards. They are either run as parts of winemaking cooperatives or are\nprivate property or property of private vineries. Because of the volcanic soils, vines grow particularly well.\nVarietals grown in the Kaiserstuhl: M\u00fcller-Thurgau, Riesling, Silvaner, Rul\u00e4nder, Blue Sp\u00e4tburgunder,\nGrauburgunder, Wei\u00dfer Burgunder, Gew\u00fcrztraminer.\nThe terrain of the Kaiserstuhl has been altered by the people living there since it was settled. The loam there\nis strongly susceptible to erosion as a result of soil cultivation, thus terraces had to be added, which were then\nmostly used as vineyards, as well as fruit growing or for other agricultural uses. As a result, the typical small\n\"patio\" hillsides and the streaked loess sunken roads typical of the region came into being.\nTo start with, it was for this reason that smaller terraces were merged in around 1950, this resulted in large\nscale reallocation, which turned parts of the original landscape completely upside down.\nThe phases of this reallocation were:-\nSmall-scale realignment between 1950 and 1960. At the same time the terrain was generally modi\ufb01ed bymanual labour with the help of in-house machines. During this time approximately 950 hectares wereenclosed by the farmland consolidation authority.\nConservation area\nEconomy\nChanges in landscape\n6/20/25, 10:48 AM Kaiserstuhl (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiserstuhl_(Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) 6/8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3063, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3241fac9-0d24-4df5-a19f-77e95df3f7bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "3241fac9-0d24-4df5-a19f-77e95df3f7bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 730880, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b3c1c6e-e13e-45f7-9dfe-881c367bc53e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sameer/Downloads/KaiserstuhlWines.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 730880, "creation_date": "2025-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-20"}, "hash": "9bc0a11166a03afd6079d4dd8556fc185db13f24434c55838883572cb8709e2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Between 1960 and 1970 the loess slopes were more comprehensively modi\ufb01ed, whereby largerectangular terraced areas with corresponding high embankments were made. The terraces werearranged with mountain like slopes so that now only the multiple slope edges are visible from the valley.About 650 hectares of the surface were styled in this way.\nThe plans to create large-scale terraces made between 1970 and 1976 were executed with the help ofheavy machinery, changing the landscape radically. Before the original, naturally formed, depressionshad still been visible in the gentle hillsides with only small terraces. Natural and man-made structuresexisted side by side. However, these small-scale structures were then obliterated completely. Monstrousareas resembling fortresses and entirely incongruous to the region were created. The total wine-growingarea of the terraces was 630\u00a0ha. As the embankments and other areas exceeded the size of the wine-growing areas, the changes affected more than twice the newly created arable area. The land reforms ofOberrotweil-Oberberg, Ihringen-Abtsweingarten, Eichstetten-H\u00e4ttlinsberg and Endingen am Kaiserstuhl-Schambach are examples of this phase.\nThe last phase of wine-growing land reforms was realized between 1976 and 1982. Due, in part, toprotests against plans for further large scale terraces the changes were not as radical as the previousphase: the maximum height for embankments was \"limited\" to 10\u00a0m and their shapes were \"made smoothand adjusted to the landscape\" (Mayer 1986, citation translated). This procedure was, for example,applied to about 330\u00a0ha of wine-growing area in Oberbergen-Ba\u00dfgeige or in Bickensohl-Herrenst\u00fcck.\nFrom 1977 on, several longer periods of enhanced precipitation caused damage to the embankments. During\none week in May 1983 for example, the amount of precipitation was so large that in some areas it was\nequivalent to one third of the annual average, causing great damage in the modified areas.\nThe surfaces of the acclivities often slid off together with the vegetation. Former valleys, which had been\nblocked due to re-allocation, were flushed out. In some terraces dramatic shear failures developed. In\naddition extensive, devastating frost damage occurred; due to the incline of the mountainside at the surfaces\nof the acclivities, cold air pockets were formed in which the vines in bloom were frostbitten. Additionally\nsubstantial frost damage occurred in the woody part of the vines, especially in the vineyards which were\nsituated in lower regions. In earlier times fruit had mostly been grown here but later this was changed to\nvineyards.\nThe activity of the farmland consolidation authority was narrowed to repairing and partly to rescheduling\nwhich at least was meant to correct the most severe consequences of the transformations from 1982 on.\nThe Kaiserstuhl area is served by the A 5 motorway. Major local roads are the L 113 that links the A5, the\nnorth side of the area and the French border; and the B 31 which connects the southside of the area with the\nFrench border, A 5 and Freiburg i.B. The area is also served by Breisgau S-Bahn. The Kaiserstuhl Railway\nruns past the range to the east, north and west, whilst the Breisach Railway passes it to the south.\nThere are many opportunities for hiking in the Kaiserstuhl. The best known trail is the North-South Trail\n(check mark: blue rhomb on yellow background) from Endingen across the Katharinenberg and the\nTotenkopf and the Neunlinden viewing point to Ihringen. From the trail there are panoramic views over the\nBlack Forest, the Upper Rhine Valley and the Vosges.\nIn 2007, eight trails were opened, each with a special theme. They have a total length of 140\u00a0km and were\nintegrated into the existing trail network (check mark: yellow rhomb on white background) of the Black\nForest Club. In doing so, the network was provided with 430 new signposts.
