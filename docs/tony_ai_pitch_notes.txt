BuyBak-AI: Not just a "Live Agent", but an "Agent" that is "ALIVE"

Problem: 

    1. All agents are either 'alawys live' (OpenAI chatbots) or 'living while u chat with them, like the support Chatbots'
    2. Most agents can't go back in time to determine outcomes (especially those involving Market Data Sets)
    3. Agents don't work in the background (when u go away, or downtimes). They expect the users to be always online.
    4. Cost of currently deployed 'live-agents' is prohibitively expensive. 


Solution: 

    Welcome to your personalized 'agent' that is 'ALIVE'

    What does this mean? Let's look at an example (expensive wines)


    Regular chatbot
    1. What kind of wines do u know? 
        - 6 french wines.....
    2. Can u tell me more about a certain wine? 
        - Yes: .....
    3. How much does this wine cost? 
        - Well, either $350 as per Wikipedia (or data that has been fed to me), or 
        - U will need to connect to several market places.....
    4. Can u monitor the prices of this wine on 'this website', and notify me when u hit a certain threshold? 
        - No. U will need to provide me with detailed instructions. Then keep the sessiomn alive, so we can communicate.
    5. What kind of detailed instructions? 

        Well, "This is the problem with existing agents... or agentic-AI in general".


    So what makes our Agentic-AI different? 

    Let's think Philosophically: 

    - BuyBak-Agent is like a Personal Assistant.
    - Its "alive" when u ask it to come online!
    - It takes instructions (wines, its historical market data, Who bought when, and how early)
    - It runs in the background (like a Personal assistant that return to their cubicle, and get to work)
    - It finds good prices (based on historical data) and NOTIFIES you. 
    - It starts monitoring LIVE prices, matches that with the historical outcomes, compares, and NOTIFIES you.
    - It WAKES-U-UP, and asks: Do u like this outcome? Yes/No. 
    - If not, it continues its task (like a personal assistant), and returns with more results.
    - Finally, when u are ready to buy, it says: I am done! Give me a new task.


    - BuyBak-Agent(s) are waiting to be 
      - Programmed/instructed to do a certain task
      - They will act like a Human Secretary
      - They will do just enough (without burning the forever-alive-aws instances)
      - And only interrupt you when they find good results (to keep moving forward)

    - U can launch multiple instances of BuyBak-Agents (that are ALIVE)
    - They will all perform a specific task (historical, live datasets) and best outcomes.
    - They will asynchronously notify you (when u set the thresholds to hit)
    - They will 'finish' and 'shutdown' when u both are satisfied with the final outcome.


BuyBak Secret Sauce: 

    Think "HFT" High-Frequency-Trading Algorithms.

    1. Our agents-that-are-ALIVE, are just like a "Headless Client" Or an HFT Algorithm.
    2. They are 'launched' by the Traders to do a specific trade.
    3. They work in the background with Historical/Quantitative-models/live-market data
    4. They take intermittent instructions from the Trader (parameterized)
    5. They NOTIFY the Trader on specific outcomes. And either 'finish' or 'continue' to operate under these tasks.
    6. Finally, the 'trader' can launch 'multiple instances' as personalized Agents that are ALIVE


BuyBak Technologies implemented: 

    Our investigation on several Agentic AI frameworks (llamaindex, LangGraph, CrewAI and MS-Automate) led us to our good old HFT Algorithmic Platform driven by 

1. FSMC: Finite State Machine Compiler (generated-workflow)

    - Robert Martin's State-Map-Compiler. The State Pattern, which we have generated since 2001
    - Timeout (Arm/Disarm-Timers) with retry: Which is missing altogether in many aforementioned frameworks
    - Multiple external events to interrupt the Agentic-Workflow, which was missing altogether
    - Async execution of sub-workflows via Synchronous REST API calls (streaming_events)
    - WebSockets to asynchronously capture the NOTIFICATIONs within the FSMC generated Workflow State Machines.

    Following describes the FSMC: Finite-State-Machine-Compiler, that generates the Workflow instance from a JSON/XML graph
    (Note: This follows the HFT Algorithmic trader mentality of feature additions and modifications)

    1. Uniform code generation of the Finite-State-Machine via FSMC
    2. Handling of FSM errors (in every state), which allows the user to handle missing stimuli in states
    3. Visualization of FSM to clearly interpret the requirements.
    4. Debugging capability via "Prev-state --> Stimulus --> Next-State" paradigm at every step of the agent that is Alive
    4. Quick turnaround of re-generated FSM and deployment.

2. Multi-Models: Regressor (Market-data/math) alongside Classifier (Document parsing/NLP)

    - ML_Forecaster (Regressor)
    - XGBoost: Curating historical market data (Regressor)
    - ToolSpec: Most powerful introduction of the LLM Agentic Workflow constructs


    Our investigation led to combining both models as AgentWorkflow
    - Curating recorded market-data (for XGBoost, and ML_Forcasting) via CSV (Note: JSON has exceptions and repercussions during Agent Execution!!!)
    - Indexing PDF documents for Classifier. 
    - Combining the two models to respond to User queries
    - Applying the live-market-data injection to both XGBoost and ML_Forecaster to present the 'Best-Price' NOTIFICATION(s)

3. BuyBak-Alive-Agentic-Foundation

    - A seemless foundation oblivious to the inputs, 
    - Provides a quick turnaround to accommodate multi-faceted clients to launch alive-agents
    - Cost-benefit-analysis: The agents run as HFT-algorithms to completion based on User Controls.
    - Results from individual agents that are alive thru the agentic-lifecycle perform directed tasks in the 'background' like a live Personal Assisstant


4. Demo

    1. High-End Wines' selection and purchase
    2. State machine demostrates all aspects of the PoC foundation.
    3. Uses test-market-data that is curated for '6-week, 5-week, 4-week' lead-time (for price-discovery),
    4. Uses live-market-data injected into the Agents to compare against curated data above.
    5. Notify the user of ideal purchase options!
    6. Continues to HUNT for price-discovery, or exit if the user has made the decision to 'BUY'.
