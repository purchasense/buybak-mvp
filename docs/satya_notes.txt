3. Blair Hull: Billionaire Trader who acquired my first business (see below).

Previous Two Exits: 

1. 2010-2014: Ketchum Trading (Blair Hull, Billionaire) acquired Sameer's Commodity Options Market Making desk (from Endeavor Trading), Chicago

   Who is Blair Hull? 
   - Blair Hull: Sold his Hull Trading to Goldman Sachs back in 1996 for $350M, and cashed out at $500M.
   - Blair Hull: Ran against Pres. Obama in 2004 Illinois Senate Seat, and lost. 
   - All of downtown, in 2010 was like: Who is this Sameer? (everyone was trying to sell themselves to Blair, the biggest trader).
   - Blair is best friends with Robert Mondavi, the Wineyard ($8-$30 wines in stores): who is now BuyBak Customer!!!
   - Endeavor gave Sameer's High-Freq-Trading desk/algos (HFT) $5M and 3x leverage = $15M: to trade livestock (Beef, Hogs, Milk)
   - After acquisition Blair gave Sameer (+ his group) $45M and 3x leverage = $135M to trade: livestock, Grains, Softs (Coffee/cotton/Cocoa/Sugar   
   We did well.

2. 2019-2023: Sameer's Takyon (also acquired): by a small stablecoin startup for $3.5M (along with his Ukrainian Engg team)

    - Takyon is an OTC trading venue connecting 7 exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, LedgerX, Deribit...) with a fullstack Virtual Accounting, and On-Ramp/Off-Ramp cross-border bank-to-bank remittance/payments via Stablecoins. Including Virtual PrePay cards (corporate/individual)
    - Stablecoin startup had raised $5M by 2021. 
    - They raised an additional $4M by July 2022 with NO software
    - They had MTL/Nacha/Sepa/VASP/MSB licenses approved in 37 states and 17 countries. They were compliant and we were tech.
    - They acquired Takyon in 2022 (we had 32 paying customers, when BTC and crypto imploded around the world in 2022/2023)
    - We had 3 suiters (Chicago, NYC, and Costa Rica): We chose this.
    - Sadly it did not materialize, and the parent company died in late 2023.
    Note: Mike Cavanaugh (Our BuyBak Broker-Dealer) was one of the big investors in the stablecoin startup, and helped acquire Takyon. 
          He has been a good resource (broker-dealer) for BuyBak post Takyon, and also invested in us since 2024.

3. So we have ALL of Takyon Engg + Codebase is the basis of BuyBak (which we had been thinking about after exiting Takyon: Long Term Game Plann

4. BuyBak Traction (Customers)

    - We launched BuyBak in September of 2024 (last year), 
    - Oct 2024 we raised $25k and $20k from blue-collar (teacher/business-owner)
    - Dec 2024: Mike Cavanaugh came on board as an advisor/investor (and broker-dealer services for 18 months with very low commissions)

Customer - 1 (Big Win)

                - They have 40,000 B2B2C clients, and offered to give us 4000 clients in 3 B2B2C businesses.
                - We crunched numbers (UNIT ECONOMICS), and showed that we can pull $10k/month, hitting $120k ARR with just our first client.
                - Then raise BIG next year to onboard the remaining 35k customers. 
                - They are continuing to grow. Their list of B2B2C customers is with us. We will be a loyalty offering within their features, white-labelled.

Customer - 2 (Another good win, with potential investment)

    - March 2025: Tony Saliba, Billionaire, liquidmercury.com, has a Secondary-market (ATS: SEC, Exchange) for 7 verticals
                 - clubdvin.com: Is one of their secondary market users.
                 - Electronic goods (BestBuy) repairs and auctions (referbished) is also using his Secondary-Market platform.
                 - We are onboarding him for the Wines business (clubdvin.com): where expensive wines are traded by subscribers.
                 - Tony is friends with Blair (who is friends with Robert Mondavi). So, Tony really got exited about Sameer.
                 - Tony wants to offer BuyBak to ALL his verticals in the Secondary Market (We are under negotiations for other verticals)
                 - We are also asking Tony for $350k at $3.5M valuation (as he is bringing Hotels/Vineyards... etc)
        - We meet Tony on tuesday after Dallas

    - April 2025: Confidential AI Anthropic investor: We are his sweet-spot. 
                 - He has a $50M+ million SPV fund. He told us.
                 - He wanted to see our PoC (which u have seen): for dynamic loyalty allocation via Agentic-AI price discovery.
                 - He said: We will take u to $25M YC-SAFE and raise $5M from our $50M+ fund. That's why we did the PoC these past 1.5 months.
        - We meet him after Dallas.

U know Dallas: IITnT.org (IITEAN network), as I am from one of the IITs (Varanasi Computer Sc. and Engg. 1995 batch). In Chicago since 1999

5. Legalese: 
    https://white-summers.com: Our Legal-Eagles.

    So, here's the thing: White-Summers, 
        - > 30 years in business
        - Helped Tesla and Hotmail (Pre-Seed/Pre-Revenue) back in the 1990s !!!
        - Hard to get, but we are now fully onboarded with them: They LOVE buybak loyalty program.
        - They manage our Captable. 
        - They are "OUR CORPORATE BYLAWS lawyers" on an expensive retainer starting Jan 2025 of this year.


        Here's the good news: 

    1. We are currently valued at $5M (YC-SAFE) raising $1M (20% equity) (post money)
    2. Given our customers, and our projected ARR = $150k+ 
       - we plan to raising another 16.67%, $5M at $30M valuation (post money)
    3. white-summers said: If u hit 150K+ ARR they will help us raise
        * $10M at a $125M valuation in 12-18 months!!! (as they did this for many first in the Bay area)
        * They want us to do the foundational work and hit our numbers!!!
        * with the Confidential AI investor on the horizon, we might pull up that!
            

Bottomline: We have nailed 2 of 3 biggest problems: 

- Checked: Acquired a broker-dealer and custodian
- Checked: Signed 2 legit big customers to generate $150k+ in ARR
- WIP:   We are looking to raise money (quickly) and start hitting the MRR/ARR with customers.


*** Also: Folks raise 'Friends-n-Family' (this PreSeed) round to chase the two items listed abovew (checked for us)
*** That's the story: We are very well positioned to hit the next round 



Vinod/Doctors can CASH OUT their principal (as we will get 6x or 10x growth multiple in this next round. And still own a significant share going into Pre-Series A and Series-A
